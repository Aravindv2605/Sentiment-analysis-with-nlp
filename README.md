**Pandas is used for creating and handling structured datasets in tabular form.

NumPy supports efficient numerical operations and array handling.

re (regular expressions) is used for cleaning text, such as removing punctuation and numbers during preprocessing.

string (imported but not used here) typically supports text manipulation tasks.

Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot are data visualization libraries. In this code, Seaborn is used to plot the confusion matrix for visual evaluation.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a key machine learning library:

train_test_split splits the dataset into training and test sets.

TfidfVectorizer converts cleaned text into numerical feature vectors based on term frequency-inverse document frequency.

LogisticRegression is used to build a binary classification model.

accuracy_score, classification_report, and confusion_matrix evaluate model performance.
